# C# Test Naming Convention

When writing unit tests in C#, a clear and consistent naming strategy plays a vital role in improving the **readability**, **maintainability**, and **understandability** of your codebase. One of the most effective and widely adopted conventions, **recommended by .NET documentation and community standards**, is the following format:

> `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior`

This article dives into what this naming convention is, why it matters, and how to apply it in real-world scenarios.

## Why Test Naming Matters

Test names serve as **living documentation**. A good test name tells you:

- What method is being tested
- Under what conditions
- What the expected outcome is

This removes the need to dive into the test body to understand its purpose and ensures that failing tests communicate issues clearly and concisely.

## Naming Pattern Breakdown

### Format

```csharp
MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior
```

| Segment            | Description                                                   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MethodName`        | The method under test                                         |
| `StateUnderTest`    | The specific context or input being tested                    |
| `ExpectedBehavior`  | The result or behavior expected from the method               |

### Real-World Examples

Consider a simple `Calculator` class:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(string numbers)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(numbers))
            return 0;

        return numbers.Split(',').Select(int.Parse).Sum();
    }
}
```

Now let’s write tests using the naming convention:

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void Add_EmptyString_ReturnsZero()
{
    var calculator = new Calculator();

    var result = calculator.Add("");

    Assert.AreEqual(0, result);
}
```

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void Add_SingleNumber_ReturnsThatNumber()
{
    var calculator = new Calculator();

    var result = calculator.Add("5");

    Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
}
```

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void Add_MultipleCommaSeparatedNumbers_ReturnsSum()
{
    var calculator = new Calculator();

    var result = calculator.Add("1,2,3");

    Assert.AreEqual(6, result);
}
```

Each test method clearly communicates its purpose without needing to read the body.

## Advantages of This Convention

* **Readable**: Test names become self-explanatory.
* **Maintainable**: Helps spot outdated, redundant, or overlapping tests quickly.
* **Debuggable**: The method name tells you exactly what went wrong and under what condition.
* **Scalable**: Works well in projects with hundreds or thousands of tests.

## Comparing Naming Styles

| Naming Style                  | Example                                          | Issue                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Vague                         | `Test1`                                          | Not descriptive              |
| Contextless                   | `Add_ReturnsCorrectValue`                        | Lacks input context          |
| BDD-style (`Given_When_Then`) | `GivenEmptyString_WhenAddCalled_ThenReturnsZero` | Verbose and less aligned     |

While BDD-style naming can work well, but `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior` hits the sweet spot for clarity and conciseness in the .NET ecosystem.

## Best Practices

* ✅ Stick to the pattern throughout your codebase for consistency.
* ✅ Use underscores to separate sections of the name.
* ✅ Focus on **behavior**, not implementation details.
* ✅ Keep names short but descriptive—avoid unnecessary verbosity.

## Conclusion

Following the `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior` convention brings clarity and purpose to your test suite. Whether you're writing tests solo or in a large team, adopting this convention makes your tests easier to read, easier to maintain, and easier to trust.

By turning your tests into well-named specifications, you make your codebase self-explanatory—and that's a huge win for quality and collaboration.
